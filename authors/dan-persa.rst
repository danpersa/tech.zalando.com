Hello! I joined Zalando in 2013, as part of the Shop Team. Since then I've been part of many interesting projects:
The Shop Filters, Article Reviews, the Shop Public API to enumerate some of them.
I've always been part of the Mentoring Team, giving monthly talks about Guava, `REST <http://danpersa.github.io/rest/>`_ to the newbies from Zalando.
I've organized several `Reading Groups <http://danpersa.github.io/reading-group/#/>`_ and some Coder Dojos at Zalando.

I'm a hobbyist photographer and I can't miss the chance of taking `nice pictures <https://500px.com/danpersa>`_.

Follow me on twitter `@danpersa <https://twitter.com/danpersa>`_ and `github <https://github.com/danpersa>`_
