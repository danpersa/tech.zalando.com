Hi, I'm a Data Scientist in the Statistical Learning group and joined Zalando in mid 2013. My 
background is quite interdisciplinary with degrees in physics, computer science and neuroscience, 
all with a strong focus on machine learning. Most of my past projects at Zalando focused on warehouse
logistics topics (picker routing, article weight estimation, inner zone stowing...). Currently, our 
group is pivoting to other applications of statistical and machine learning methodologies, while expanding 
our expertise in deep learning applied to complex problems, such as computer vision.

Check out all my posts:
